# ViewPal
Developed a live video captioning model called ViewPal that was based on combining the information extracted from the video using a Convolutional Neural Network and extracting this information using a Recurrent Neural Network into a stream of meaningful sentences. 
Reads out the sentence to aid the visually challenged by providing a live relay of events around them.
